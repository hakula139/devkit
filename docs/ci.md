Pass `macos: false` to the `nix` job to skip the macOS leg. The Linux leg still evaluates every system's outputs with `nix flake check --all-systems`, so leave a package out of each system its `meta.platforms` excludes.

Pass the `nix` job a `timeout_minutes` above the default 45 if a cold build needs longer.

`nix.yml` runs `nix flake check` on each leg, which builds only the `checks` outputs, so expose the package as a check to have CI build it:

```nix
checks.package = self.packages.${system}.default;
```

The Linux leg then runs `nix develop -c run-hooks`, and the macOS leg enters the dev shell to build the darwin hook tools, so `devShells.default` must include the [`preCommit` shell](hooks.md#set-up-the-dev-shell).

The [branch ruleset](github.md#apply-the-branch-ruleset) requires `CI Result`, so add every new check job to its `needs`. The gate skips any job that is still running, so a job missing from `needs` that finishes after the gate starts is never checked.

Every run reads the public `hakula` Cachix cache, and `nix.yml` pushes builds to it only from the default branch. Create a `CACHIX_AUTH_TOKEN` secret to enable pushing.
